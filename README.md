## My process

### 🛠️ Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### 💡What I learned

**CSS Grid Container:** A grid container contains one or more grid items arranged in columns and rows. All direct child elements of a grid container automatically become grid items. An element becomes a grid container when its display property is set to grid or inline-grid.


**The z-index property:** specifies the stack order of an element. An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order. **Note:** z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) and flex items (elements that are direct children of display:flex elements).

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
-----
```

```css 
.content {
  display: grid;
}


img {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: -1;
}
```
```js
-----
```



### 🧗‍♂️​Continued development

- Frameworks


### 📖 Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/) - A very comprehensive resource with tutorials, explanations, and references for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I found it very useful for completing this challenge and will continue to use it.

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Another great resource for learning to program, and I used it to complete this challenge. I recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
